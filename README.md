# Power-Changer
just download and extract then change the following:
-Custom.bat can be changed to whatever you want
-in both Balanced.bat and Custom.bat you have to set a powerplan id which you can get by running *powecfg /list*
-in the Power Changer.ps1 under line 2 you can add, remove and rename options
-at line 48 are the options, you can change: 
Start-Process ".\Balanced.bat"
and Write-Host "Applying Balanced Profile" to change the path and the running message
-and last i reccomend using the link included, it should contain:
Path: *C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "location of the Power Changer folder"*
Run inside: *"Location of the Power Changer folder"*
